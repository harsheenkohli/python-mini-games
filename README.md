## Project Descriptions

- [Data Repository](data): A designated directory housing the pertinent papers utilized for in-depth data analysis within the NLP.py project.
- [Anagram Magic Game](Anagram-Magic.py): A two-player interactive word game challenging participants to unscramble letters and form the correct words.
- [Facebook Sentiment Analysis Tool](Facebook-sentiment-analysis.py): An application designed for sentiment analysis of Facebook data, enabling insightful sentiment assessment.
- [Flames Calculator Game](Flames-Calculator.py): A Python game for assessing relationship compatibility by calculating the FLAMES acronym, offering a lighthearted perspective on interpersonal connections.
- [GPS Route Generation](GPS.py): A Python script dedicated to creating Google Maps routes based on coordinates provided in a CSV file (route.csv in this repository).
- [Image Processing Mini Project](Image-processing.py): A mini-project focusing on various aspects of image processing.
- [Magic Square Generator](Magic-Square.py): A program designed to generate magic squares, showcasing mathematical and algorithmic prowess.
- [Monte Hall Problem Solver](Monte-Hall.py): A Python program addressing the intriguing Monte Hall problem, offering a practical demonstration and solution.
- [Custom Map Output](MyMap.html): A storage location for the output generated by GPS.py, featuring custom maps and routes.
- [Natural Language Processing Mini Project](NLP.py): A Python data analysis initiative employing word length distribution criteria for the purpose of discerning and assessing distinct authorial styles through the field of stylometry. The project's ultimate goal is to attribute authorship to disputed papers.
- [Random Walk](Random-Walk.py): A project that simulates a random walk on a directed graph, where crawlers take random paths on websites and rank the websites based on visit counts. Google's PageRank system, which relies on directed graphs, serves as an inspiration for this project.
- [Geospatial Data CSV](Route.csv): A structured CSV file for the storage of latitude and longitude coordinates, tailored to streamline mapping and geospatial analysis. This resource is integral to the functionality of the GPS.py project.
- [Snakes and Ladders Game](Snakes-n-Ladders.py): A Python implementation of the classic Snakes and Ladders board game, providing an interactive gaming experience.
- [Spiral Animation Script](Spiral-Animation.py): A Python script dedicated to creating captivating spiral animations, showcasing creative and visual programming.
- [Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation](Tic-Tac-Toe.py): A Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, offering a platform for strategic gameplay.
